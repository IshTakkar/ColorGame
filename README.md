# ColorGame
ColorGame is a game which tests your RGB knowledge.
This game has two modes: Easy and Hard. You have to select one of the squares whose colour corresponds to the RGB value written in the heading. Colours can be reset if the current pallete seems too hard by clicking the 'New Colours' button.
